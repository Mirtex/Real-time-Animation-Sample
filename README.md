# Real-time Animation Sample

This is a project from Full Sail's Real time animation class. Most code was written by
me with the exception of the FBXLoader that was provided to us due to time contraints.

Controls:
Move camera with WASD keys.

Animations:
Use the function keys to switch between animations (F1 and F2 currently implemented.)

Graphics:
Use TAB and Q to enable/disable polygons in order to observe joints or wireframes.
